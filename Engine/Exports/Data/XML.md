## XML

**XML** (eXtensible Markup Language) is a text format that is used to store structured data (in exchange for existed files of data bases), for exchange of information between programs and also to create on its base the special markup languages (for example, XHTML), sometimes called dictionaries. XML is the hierarchical structure that is used to store any data. Visually this structure can be represented as the tree. XML supports Unicode and other encoding.


> **Information**
>
> Only those data (components) are exported to the XML format which are placed on data bands.

### Controlling Exports

The following elements can be specified in the Tag field to control export to XML:

DataType

ExportType : "FieldName"

Column: "FieldName" "DataRow"


Several elements should be separated with the semicolon. The “DataType" element should be only one and should be placed first, other elements – if necessary.


Values of the "DataType" element are shown in the table below. If the data type is not set, then the **string** data type is taken by default.


| **Data type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| int | Numeric |
| long | Numeric |
| float | Decimal |
| double | Decimal |
| string | Text |
| date | Date |

The "**ExportType**" element indicates for which export the field name is set. The values can be used: “dbf”, “csv”, “xml”, “default”. The "FieldName" element indicates the field name in the file. The own name can be specified to each type of export. If the name for each export is not specified then the name for the “default” type is taken. For example:


DBF : "Describe" ; XML : "Description" ; default: "Default name"


The "Column" element indicates that additional field is added to the exported data. The "FieldName" element indicates the name of a new field. The "DataRow" element indicates the content of a new field and can be expression. For example:


Column: "SortField" "{Products.Categories.CategoryName}"
